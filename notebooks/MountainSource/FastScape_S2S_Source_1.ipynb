    "2. *core*: the boundary is reflective (no flux of material allowed), which means that rivers must \"bounce back\" from such boundaries;\n",
    "3. *looped*: or cyclic boundary conditions, which means that material flowing through the boundary \"reappears\" automatically on the opposite boundary; note that *looped* boundaries must be specified as opposite pairs.\n",
